# Backgrounder
Glasses have evolved beyond mere vision correction tools. They have become statements of personal style that define one's personality and self-image. The move to offer glasses for online purchase is inevitable, given the rapid growth of e-commerce in the internet age, where there has been a general transition from traditional physical stores to online shopping for various products and services [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296302003600?via%3Dihub). The global eyewear market, encompassing various products like glasses and related items, reached an estimated value of around 170 billion USD in 2022, and it is projected to continue growing to approximately 323.8 billion USD by 2030 [[2]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/300087/global-eyewear-market-value/). In Indonesia, eyewear market revenue in 2023 reached about 684.20 million USD, with an estimated annual growth of 6.85% (CAGR 2023-2027) [[3]](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/eyewear/indonesia). Therefore, this indicates that the use and purchase of glasses will continue to rise. One of the largest segments in the eyewear market is the frame segment, estimated to have a market volume of about 388.40 million USD in 2023 [[3]](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/eyewear/indonesia). Selecting the right eyeglass frames for one's face shape is crucial as it can enhance aesthetics, comfort, self-confidence, functional considerations, as well as style and personality. However, consumers of various age groups have expressed concerns about the fitting of their glasses when shopping online [[4]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/opo.12689). This aligns with the results of our survey involving 101 respondents - find details [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/iamsofyann/viz/VirtuakuSurveyResults/Story1). In the survey results, it was evident that 70.3% of the respondents had experienced the mistake of choosing glasses that didn't suit their face shape. Meanwhile, 74.2% of the study participants admitted to having difficulty in choosing suitable eyeglass frames, and 27.7% of them even face such difficulties on a regular basis. Interestingly, 97% of respondents were interested in virtual try-on eyewear apps. We plan to develop a mobile application that helps individuals find glasses that fit their face by virtually trying them on first. Our plan is to create an innovative way to determine the user's face type and find – and buy – glasses that suit that face type. The app is therefore expected to be a valuable partner in the consumer's journey towards choosing the right pair of glasses, reducing excessive purchases due to mistakenly choosing glasses that do not fit their face.
